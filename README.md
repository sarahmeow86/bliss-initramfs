## Contributions

### Poetry (Virtual Environments & Dependency Management)

You can easily install Poetry on your machine and then run
`poetry install` from the root of this repository to have
poetry automatically create a virtual environment and install
any Python based dependencies for the project (Including all
development dependencies like `black` and `beautysh`).

### Black (Code Formatting - Python)

If making changes to any Python code, make sure to run `black`
on the code. The correct `black` version should have been installed
after having ran `poetry install`.

### Beautysh (Code Formatting - Bash)

If making changes to any bash files (i.e files/init), please run
`beautysh` on that file and re-test your changes. If it still works,
you can submit your PR.
